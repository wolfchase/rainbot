## Core Module Commands

- __info__

    It will give you info about the bot! Try it, its fun! And totally not a way of promoting my work!

## Umbrella Module Commands

- __hash__

    Uses a naive hashing algorithm to well, produce a hash. Feed it a string and it will do its work.
    If you don't provide it anything, it will use your nick instead.

- __cal__

    Does math! You can also save functions for later use! Stuff like f(x) = x * x is valid! Das cool right?
    
    ... You do like math right?

- __jip__

    It will take JavaScript code and evaluate it. That's it.

    I was gonna call it jsnip, for JavaScript Snippet, but jip sounds 20% cooler.

- __roll__

    It lets you roll a die or many of any size, once or many times.

    General Syntax:

        .roll <number-of-rolls>r <size-of-die>d <size-of-pairs>p.
        
    Arguments are optional and can be mixed. And no, the random generator is not that smart.

    Here are some examples:
    - .roll           | Rolls a regular six sided die
    - .roll 20d       | Rolls a 20-sided die
    - .roll 10d 5r    | Rolls a 10-sided die 5 times
    - .roll 10d 2r 3p | Rolls three 10-sided dice 2 times
